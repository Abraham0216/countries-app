## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TailwindCSS
- Axios
- React Icons
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project, I mastered how to manage API apps and connect them with your apps. Using Axios (a great library) was a great help in simplifying this task. It is very useful and is one of the best when it's to API connection with your app. Also using Tailwind for the styles (game changer) It's the best to create beautiful and attractive pages. Again managing states with React gives you great advantages over Vanilla JS. 


### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on APIs, I think Axios will help out a lot, and without a doubt, I will master this skill. I enjoyed doing this great challenge and project. I'll keep doing stuff like this in the future and I'm sure it will make me a better developer. I plan to stay on top of the latest trends in API development and stay up-to-date with the best practices in the industry.
